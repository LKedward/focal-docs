# About

The goal of Focal is to provide a concise and accessible Fortran interface to the OpenCL API while retaining the full functionality thereof.
This is desirable in Fortran which as a language provides a higher level of abstraction than C; importantly this allows scientists and engineers to focus on their domain specific problem rather than details of low-level implementation.

Focal officially supports OpenCL v1.2 features.

## Project status

The Focal project is __Beta__ development:

* All major features are implemented and documented

ToDo:

* Sub-buffer creation
* Check event execution status
* Allow multiple vendors to be specified in fclCreateContext
* Test suite
* Example codes
