# About

The goal of Focal is to provide a concise and accessible Fortran interface to the OpenCL API while retaining the full functionality thereof.
This is desirable in Fortran which as a language provides a higher level of abstraction than C; importantly this allows scientists and engineers to focus on their domain specific problem rather than details of low-level implementation.

The aims for Focal in particular are to:

- remove the need to use c pointers in Fortran for the OpenCL API;
- provide some level of type-safety through the use of typed buffer objects;
- decrease the verbosity of the API calls while still providing the same functionality;
- abstract away low-level details, such as buffer size in bytes, not appropriate to Fortran;
- make it easier to write, debug and profile OpenCL programs.

Focal supports a subset of OpenCL v1.2 features.

## Project status

The Focal project is __Beta__ development:

* All major features are implemented and documented

ToDo:

* User events
* Sub-buffer creation
* Pinned memory allocation on host
* CMake build
* Quick reference card
